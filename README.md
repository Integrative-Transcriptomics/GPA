# GPA - Genome Profile Alignment

Detailed description will follow soon.

## Dependencies

* progressiveMauve
* Java Virtual Machine (JRE 11)


## Usage

<code>$ java -jar GPA.jar [GPAconfig File]</code>


## Config File Parameters

The config file has to contain the following information:

* progressiveMauve executable location
* directory for output 
* directory containing the genome file in fasta-format
* guide tree (Parsnp & progressiveMauve are currently supportet)
* maximal merge size for guide tree compression 

An Example for the config file structure with the respective entries is contained in this repository

Note: If you are using a guide tree generated by progressiveMauve, an addition file listing all genomes is needed. The ordering of the genomes has to match the input ordering of progressiveMauve.


## Output

After computation the output directory contains the following file:

* Folders for intermediate WGAs, which are used in the merging process
* Folder containing the final WGA (mergedSG)
